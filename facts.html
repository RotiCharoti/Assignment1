            <p class="para2">Monroe, also known as Norma Jeane Dougherty then (Was known as Norma Jeane Baker before marrying her 
                husband, James Dougherty) signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, an American film studio. Then when it was time 
                to choose a stage name for her, studio executive Ben Lyon sugguested that she use the stage name Marilyn Monroe.<br></b><br></b>
                Monroe's first choice was originally Jean Adair, but the name Marilyn Monroe was chosen after much consideration 
                from Lyon. <br></b><br></b> Lyon wanted Monroe to have a shorter name with more flair, hence he came up with the name Marilyn. 
                Lyon came up with it as Monroe reminded him of Marilyn Miller, the Ziegfeld Follies BroadWay musical star who 
                starred with him and W.C. Fields in <i>Her Majesty, Love</i>. (Miller and Lyon were also thought to have been romantically 
                involved at one point) There were multiple points of similarity between the two stars as well, they were both blonde 
                and had complicated personal lives, including failed marriages. <br></b><br></b>For the name Monroe, it was decided as it was the
                maiden name of Monroe's mother, and that the two M's, Marilyn Monroe, have a nice ring to it. <br></b><br></b>The choices for 
                Monroe's stage name continued to pile up as her friend suggested other stage names such as Clare Norman, Meridith, 
                and even Carol Lind.

            <p class="para2">Marilyn Monroe, the popular actress of Hollywood seems to have an inner switch that she flips to 
                turn "Marilyn" on and off whenever she wants to.<br></b><br></b> In one of the recounts, Susan Strasberg was walking with Monroe 
                when they noticed a group of fans waiting for Marilyn's return at the Waldorf. Monroe asked Strasberg "Do you want 
                to see me be her?" Monroe left Strasberg in a state of confusion as she made some inner adjustments, seemingly to 
                "turn on" the switch inside her before presenting herself to the public. She stated "there she was — not the simple 
                girl I'd been strolling with, but 'Marilyn Monroe', resplendent, ready for her public." <br></b><br></b> There are other recounts of 
                such an event as well with Actor Eli Wallach and photographer Sam Shaw, where they have witnessed Monroe referring to 
                Marilyn in third person. Shaw  frequently overheard her criticizing "Marilyn's" acting in films or during photo shoots,
                saying things such as,"She wouldn't do this. Marilyn would say that."

        <div class="box3">
            <p class="para2">To celebrate President John F.Kennedy's birthday on May 19, 1962, Monroe wore a flesh-coloured sheer, 
                sprangled dress that was embedded with jewels to deliver the president a sultry "Happy birthday" serenade.<br></b><br></b> The dress 
                was later put up for auction by the widow of Monroe's acting coach, Lee Strasberg in 1999. It sold for a grand total 
                of $1,267,500 to a Manhattan-based collectible company. When the reporters asked the president, Robert Schargen, why 
                he would pay a huge sum for a piece of clothing, that was originally $12,00, he simply proclaim that he would have paid 
                twice of that if he had to, and even boasted saying "We stole it". <br></b><br></b>Another popular dress that was sold for a high 
                price was the white dress worn by Monroe in the 1955 film, <i>The Seven Year Itch</i>.<br></b><br></b>The white dress was originally part 
                of a collection of film memorabilia collected by actress Debbie Reynolds for over four decades. It was put up for 
                auction by Reynolds as one of the Hollywood Memorabilia and was sold for $4.6m at an auction in Los Angeles during 
                the year of 2011.

            <p class="para2">At the passing of Monroe, she had owned an increadible amount of books that goes over 400 volumes,
            including several first editions. A director that once found her reading R.M Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet, 
            he asked her how she chose it, and she replied<i> "[On] nights when I've got nothing else to do I go to the Pickwick 
            bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard," , "And I just open books at random — or when I come to a page or a paragraph I 
            like, I buy that book. So last night I bought this one. Is it wrong?"</i>

        <div class="box3">
            <p class="para2">In the early years of World War II, Monroe was a teenaged housewife named Norma Jeane Dougherty. 
                During the war, she went to work in a factory that made military drones. There, she was discovered by a 
                photographer searching for subjects to inspire the troops. Monroe became a model and went on to take risqué 
                pin-up photos that would be hugely popular with soldiers in Korea. After she'd transformed into an actress called 
                Marilyn Monroe, army publication Stars & Stripes dubbed her "Miss Cheesecake of 1951" as her film career was taking 
                off.<br></b><br></b>In February 1954, Monroe showed her appreciation for these admirers by calling off her honeymoon with second 
                husband Joe DiMaggio to visit military personnel in Korea. She performed a routine that had her onstage wearing 
                a shimmering purple outfit, and it was very popular. Despite the frigid conditions that led to her pneumonia, 
                she performed ten gigs in four days. The event, as Monroe subsequently remarked, <i>"was the best thing that ever 
                happened to me. I never felt like a star before in my heart."</i>

        <div class="box5">
            <p class="para2">It wasn't just during her marriage to Miller, which ended in divorce in 1961, that Monroe 
                developed her political awareness. Along with his former roommate Shelley Winters, Monroe participated 
                in demonstrations against the erosion of civil liberties brought on by anti-Communist passion. On a movie 
                set, she was reportedly reprimanded for reading a "radical" biography of muckraker Lincoln Steffens. 
                Raised to adopt more progressive racial beliefs, Monroe went on to support civil rights.Monroe was chosen 
                to serve as an alternative delegate to the Connecticut state Democratic convention in 1960; however, 
                she did not attend the convention as it was mostly an honorary post. Additionally, she once told reporters, 
                "The H-bomb is my nightmare." Which is yours? It is therefore not surprising that she became affiliated with 
                the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy's Hollywood branch. In her file from 1962, the FBI, which was still 
                monitoring her, wrote: "Subject's views are very positively and concisely leftist; however, if she is being 
                actively used by the Communist Party, it is not general knowledge among those working with the movement in Los 
                Angeles."

        <div class="box4">
            <p class="para2">Despite spending time in foster homes and institutions, Monroe's generosity was evident 
                throughout her life. Giving away a priceless fur coat to an acting instructor, she also gave money to 
                those in need. Her shopping partners would frequently discover that Monroe had sent them things that she 
                had supposedly bought for herself. She offered support to organizations that support children, such as the 
                Milk Fund for Babies and the March of Dimes, and was particularly giving to children.Even after Monroe's passing, 
                the same kindness persists. Dr. Kris received a portion of Monroe's estate, although Strasberg received the majority 
                of it. Kris left a portion of Monroe's estate to the Anna Freud Center in England in 1980. Given her personal 
                experiences, Monroe would probably be proud to support this organization, which helps kids with mental health issues.

                Rumor had it that Fitzgerald's race prevented her from performing at the Mocambo Club. Fitzgerald wasn't deemed 
                glamorous enough to perform at the club, according to later revelations from the owners, who had previously 
                permitted Black singers like Eartha Kitt and Dorothy Dandridge to perform. When Marilyn realized this, she 
                intervened and threatened to sit in the front row every night if Fitzgerald was allowed to play. Fitzgerald was 
                given the opportunity to perform because it was known that Marilyn would attract a sizable audience.
