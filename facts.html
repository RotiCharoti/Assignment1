            <p class="para2">Monroe, also known as Norma Jeane Dougherty then (Was known as Norma Jeane Baker before marrying her 
                husband, James Dougherty) signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, an American film studio. Then when it was time 
                to choose a stage name for her, studio executive Ben Lyon sugguested that she use the stage name Marilyn Monroe.<br></b><br></b>
                Monroe's first choice was originally Jean Adair, but the name Marilyn Monroe was chosen after much consideration 
                from Lyon. <br></b><br></b> Lyon wanted Monroe to have a shorter name with more flair, hence he came up with the name Marilyn. 
                Lyon came up with it as Monroe reminded him of Marilyn Miller, the Ziegfeld Follies BroadWay musical star who 
                starred with him and W.C. Fields in Her Majesty, Love. (Miller and Lyon were also thought to have been romantically 
                involved at one point) There were multiple points of similarity between the two stars as well, they were both blonde 
                and had complicated personal lives, including failed marriages. <br></b><br></b>For the name Monroe, it was decided as it was the
                maiden name of Monroe's mother, and that the two M's, Marilyn Monroe, have a nice ring to it. <br></b><br></b>The choices for 
                Monroe's stage name continued to pile up as her friend suggested other stage names such as Clare Norman, Meridith, 
                and even Carol Lind.

            <p class="para2">Marilyn Monroe, the popular actress of Hollywood seems to have an inner switch that she flips to 
                turn "Marilyn" on and off whenever she wants to.<br></b><br></b> In one of the recounts, Susan Strasberg was walking with Monroe 
                when they noticed a group of fans waiting for Marilyn's return at the Waldorf. Monroe asked Strasberg "Do you want 
                to see me be her?" Monroe left Strasberg in a state of confusion as she made some inner adjustments, seemingly to 
                "turn on" the switch inside her before presenting herself to the public. She stated "there she was â€” not the simple 
                girl I'd been strolling with, but 'Marilyn Monroe', resplendent, ready for her public." <br></b><br></b> There are other recounts of 
                such an event as well with Actor Eli Wallach and photographer Sam Shaw, where they have witnessed Monroe referring to 
                Marilyn in third person. Shaw  frequently overheard her criticizing "Marilyn's" acting in films or during photo shoots,
                saying things such as,"She wouldn't do this. Marilyn would say that."

            <p class="para2">To celebrate President John F.Kennedy's birthday on May 19, 1962, Monroe wore a flesh-coloured sheer, 
                sprangled dress that was embedded with jewels to deliver the president a sultry "Happy birthday" serenade. The dress 
                was later put up for auction by the widow of Monroe's acting coach, Lee Strasberg in 1999. It sold for a grand total 
                of $1,267,500 to a Manhattan-based collectible company. When the reporters asked the president, Robert Schargen, why 
                he would pay a huge sum for a piece of clothing, that was originally $12,00, he simply proclaim that he would have paid 
                twice of that if he had to, and even boasted saying "We stole it". Another popular dress that was sold for a high 
                price was the white dress worn by Monroe in the 1955 film, The Seven Year Itch.The white dress was originally part 
                of a collection of film memorabilia collected by actress Debbie Reynolds for over four decades. It was put up for 
                auction by Reynolds as one of the Hollywood Memorabilia and was sold for $4.6m at an auction in Los Angeles during 
                the year of 2011.
