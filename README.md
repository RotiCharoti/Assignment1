# Assignment1
This website serves as a biography of the famous actress, Marilyn Monroe. Despite her passing in the 1960s, the name Marilyn Monroe is still known to many in this current generation and era. Whether she is known as a sex symbol or that she was a rising actress back in the 1900s, people still recognize her as one of the iconic figures from the past. Hence, this biography will be a short history of Monroe's career and life. It details Monroe's rise to fame as well as her ongoing struggles in her life despite seeming to have it all. Additionally, there will be interesting facts and a quiz added to the website as well. For readers who are interested in learning more about Monroe or simply want to learn more about her, this biography will be a great place to start.

 
 # Design Process
This short biography should be able to provide sufficient information for readers to understand. However, it will be too boring to read through all the information like a history textbook. I want the readers to enjoy what they are reading and be able to digest the information easily. Hence, for the website, I selected colors that are bold, empowering, and feminine, fitting Monroe's image. Information on Monroe's life and career are included in the biography, and a section on interesting facts about Monroe was added for the readers to enjoy and perhaps laugh about to lighten their mood, as the personal life of Monroe can be rather heavy. A quiz is also added at the end for the users to take, serving as a mini-challenge for the readers and making it more fun for them. For the design of the website, Adobe XD was used to visualize it.
