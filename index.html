            Marilyn Monroe, an actress, triumphed over a challenging upbringing to establish herself as one 
            of the most iconic and enduring sex icons globally. Over $200 million was made from her films. Her 
            connections to Joe DiMaggio, Arthur Miller, and possibly President John F. Kennedy are well known. 
            At the age of just 36, Monroe overdosed on drugs and passed away on August 5, 1962.
