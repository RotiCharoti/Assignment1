        <br></b><br></b>

        <div class="box2">
            <p class="para2">On June 1, 1962, Mailyn Monroe was born in Los Angeles, California. At birth, Monroe was given the 
                name Norma Jeane Mortenson (she was baptized as Baker Jeane Baker later on). Monroe was raised mostly in foster 
                care and an orphanage, while her mother Gladys Pearl Baker was frequently institutionalized. Monroe was raised 
                in an orphanage for a while as well as by twelve different sets of foster parents. <br></b><br></b> Monroe was unaware of her father. 
                She once believed Clark Gable to be her father; this is a story that has been told frequently enough to become somewhat 
                well-known. Nevertheless, there's no proof that Gable was acquainted with or ever met Monroe's mother. <br></b><br></b>Monroe was cared 
                for for a few years in 1937 by a family friend and her husband, Grace and Doc Goddard. Monroe's mother paid the 
                Goddards $25 a week to raise her. <br></b><br></b>Monroe was not permitted to go to the movies, among other forbidden activities, 
                because the couple was fervently religious and adhered to fundamentalist beliefs. However, the couple could not 
                afford to take Monroe with them when Goddard's work was moved to the East Coast.

            <p class="para2">Monroe was sexually assaulted multiple times while living in foster homes when she was seven years old. 
                She subsequently claimed to have been raped when she was eleven years old. When she was fifteen, she left high school.
                <br></b><br></b>
                Monroe saw marriage as a means of escape, and at the age of sixteen, she married Jimmy Dougherty, a merchant marine, 
                in 1942. However, their marriage ended in divorce shortly after World War II.
